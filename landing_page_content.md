---

## 4. PROBLEM SECTION

### Main Heading
**Manually reviewing code is a hassle.**

### Problem Cards (3 columns)

#### üïê Waiting Days for Reviews
Your pull requests sit idle while teammates juggle their own workload. Development velocity grinds to a halt, and deployment schedules slip. Critical bugs that could've been caught early make it to production.

#### üéØ Inconsistent Quality
Code review quality depends on who's available and how much time they have. Junior developers don't get the detailed feedback they need to improve. Security vulnerabilities slip through when reviewers are rushed.

#### üîí Security Risks
Manual reviews miss subtle SQL injections, XSS attacks, and hardcoded API keys. One missed vulnerability can lead to data breaches costing thousands or millions. Traditional linters only catch syntax issues, not logic flaws.

---

## 5. SOLUTION SECTION

### Main Heading
**Empower Your Development with AI Code Reviews**

### Subheading
Generic AI tools won't suffice. Our platform is purpose-built to provide exceptional code analysis for your specific needs‚Äîfrom security audits to performance optimization.

### Solution Features (4 cards with icons)

#### ü§ñ Advanced AI Algorithms
Powered by Google Gemini, our AI analyzes code with 90%+ accuracy in detecting vulnerabilities, performance issues, and code smells. Get insights comparable to a senior developer reviewing your code.

#### üîê Secure Data Handling
We prioritize your code security with end-to-end encryption and strict privacy protocols. Your code is analyzed in real-time and never stored permanently. SOC 2 Type II compliant.

#### üîÑ Seamless Integration
Paste code directly, drag-and-drop files, or connect your GitHub repository. Works with your existing workflow‚Äîno complex setup required. Results in under 10 seconds.

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Customizable Analysis
Tailor the review depth to your needs. Focus on security for production code, performance for backend services, or best practices for learning projects. Language-specific recommendations included.

---

## 6. HOW IT WORKS

### Heading
**Just 3 steps to get started**

### Step-by-Step Process (with numbers and visuals)

#### Step 1: Submit Your Code
**Choose your method:**
- Paste code directly into our Monaco-powered editor

- ‚ö° Performance bottlenecks (O(n¬≤) algorithms, memory leaks)
- ‚ú® Best practice violations (naming, structure, patterns)
- üîß Refactoring opportunities (code smells, duplications)

**Processing time:** 5-10 seconds average

#### Step 3: Get Actionable Feedback
**Review detailed results:**
- Color-coded severity levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- Specific line numbers with issue descriptions
- Before/after code examples showing fixes
- Detailed explanations for learning

**Save to history** for tracking improvements over time.

## 11. FAQ SECTION

### Heading
**Frequently Asked Questions**

### Questions (Accordion-style expandable)

**Q: How accurate is the AI analysis?**  
A: Our AI achieves 90-95% accuracy in detecting security vulnerabilities and common code issues. It's powered by Google Gemini and trained on millions of code examples. However, we recommend using it as a complement to‚Äînot replacement for‚Äîhuman code reviews on critical production code.

**Q: What programming languages do you support?**  
A: We currently support JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, C++, Go, Ruby, PHP, JSX, TSX, and more. We add new languages monthly based on user requests. Check our changelog for the latest additions.

**Q: Is my code safe and private?**  
A: Absolutely. Your code is transmitted over HTTPS with TLS 1.3 encryption and analyzed in real-time. We don't store your code snippets permanently‚Äîonly the analysis results if you choose to save them. We're SOC 2 Type II certified and GDPR compliant.

**Q: Can I use this for work/commercial projects?**  
A: Yes! All plans allow commercial use without restrictions. Review code for client projects, your company, or personal commercial ventures.

**Q: How fast is the analysis?**  
A: Most reviews complete in 5-10 seconds. Files with 10,000+ lines may take up to 30 seconds. We prioritize accuracy over speed, but aim to stay under 15 seconds for 95% of requests.

**Q: What makes this better than ESLint or Pylint?**  
A: Traditional linters catch syntax and style issues. We go deeper: security vulnerabilities, algorithmic performance, architectural improvements, and provide detailed explanations with code examples. Think of us as a senior developer, not just a style checker.

**Q: Can I cancel anytime?**  
A: Yes, cancel with one click in your dashboard. No questions asked, no cancellation fees. Your reviews remain accessible for 30 days after cancellation.

**Q: Do you offer refunds?**  
A: Yes! 30-day money-back guarantee on all paid plans. If you're not satisfied, email support@codereview-ai.com for a full refund.

**Q: When will GitHub integration be available?**  
A: GitHub integration is in beta testing now! Pro and Team plan users will get early access. Expected general release: Q2 2025.

**Q: Can I customize the analysis criteria?**  
A: Custom rules and organization-specific standards are available on Team plans. You can define your company's coding standards, frameworks, and priorities.
